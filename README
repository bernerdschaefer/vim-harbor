== vim-harbor
vim-harbor is a vim plugin for working with harbor projects inspired by tpope/vim-rails.

== Usage

  NOTE: Your application will need to follow the default Harbor layout where the root folder's
        name matches the application's lib folder, e.g., project_name/lib/project_name.rb and
        project_name/lib/project_name/*
